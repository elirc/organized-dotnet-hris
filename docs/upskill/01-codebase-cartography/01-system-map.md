## Runtime Boundaries

| Boundary | Evidence | What crosses it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Browser -> API | [client/src/api.ts](../../../client/src/api.ts#L90-L105) | JSON requests and optional bearer token. |
| API -> SQLite | [server/Nethris.Api/Program.cs](../../../server/Nethris.Api/Program.cs#L14-L15), [appsettings.json](../../../server/Nethris.Api/appsettings.json#L2-L4) | EF Core DbContext operations. |
| API -> JWT consumer | [JwtTokenService.cs](../../../server/Nethris.Api/Security/JwtTokenService.cs#L21-L38) | Signed claims for user, role, employee id. |
| Client demo fallback | [client/src/api.ts](../../../client/src/api.ts#L24-L39) | Local demo data when API login cannot be reached. |

## Public Interfaces

- Minimal API endpoints are declared in [Program.cs](../../../server/Nethris.Api/Program.cs#L68-L395).
- Response/request records are declared in [Contracts.cs](../../../server/Nethris.Api/Contracts/Contracts.cs#L5-L109).
- React has no router package; tabs are local state in [App.tsx](../../../client/src/App.tsx#L19-L37) and rendered conditionally in [App.tsx](../../../client/src/App.tsx#L210-L352).

## Confirmed Absences

No `.sln`, `global.json`, `Directory.Build.props`, `Directory.Packages.props`, `nuget.config`, test project, CI workflow, Dockerfile, compose file, EF migrations folder, hosted service, queue, or `IHttpClientFactory` usage was found by file inventory excluding `node_modules`.

## Judgment Drill

Draw three boxes: Client, API, Database. Put each file above into one box. Then mark which files you would touch for "add sick leave type". If your answer touches only the UI, you missed persistence and contract ownership.
